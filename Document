Case Study: Enhancing Membership Conversion Through Data-Driven Insights for Cyclistic Bike-Share

Executive Summary
This case study explores the usage patterns of Cyclistic, a bike-share company, to develop targeted strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. By leveraging data analytics, we identify critical trends and propose actionable insights to drive membership growth and enhance overall service efficiency.

Introduction
Cyclisticâ€™s goal is to maximize the number of annual memberships, as they are more profitable compared to casual rides. This analysis delves into how casual riders and annual members use the service differently, aiming to tailor marketing strategies that convert casual riders based on data-driven insights.

Data Preparation and Cleaning
- **Source:** Simulated data representing ride durations, distances, and ratings.
- **Cleaning Steps:**
  - Addressed missing values by imputing median values.
  - Corrected outliers and capped extreme values at the 99th percentile.
  - Standardized ride ratings to ensure they fell within the expected range.

Descriptive Analysis
- **Ride Durations:** Average duration is about 20 minutes, with most rides lasting between 16 to 23 minutes.
- **Ride Distances:** Average distance covered is approximately 5.5 miles, typically ranging from 3.2 to 7.7 miles.
- **Ride Ratings:** The average rating is around 3, indicating a moderate level of satisfaction among users.

In-depth Analysis
Specific Investigations:
1. **Popular Start Stations:**
   - Identified stations with the highest traffic to optimize bike and dock availability.
2. **Longest Trip Durations:**
   - Highlighted the longest trips to understand usage patterns for potential operational improvements.

Visualizations:
- Histograms for ride durations and distances to illustrate the distribution of trips.
- Scatter plots to explore the relationship between ride duration and distance with an overlay of ride ratings.
- Time series analysis to depict trends and seasonal variations in ride usage.

Key Insights
- **Usage Patterns:** Casual riders often use the service for longer durations, suggesting leisure or non-commute purposes.
- **Operational Hotspots:** Certain stations consistently experience high traffic, indicating the need for better resource allocation.
